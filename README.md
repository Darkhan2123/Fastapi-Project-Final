# FastAPI + React Crypto Dashboard

This project serves as the capstone for a course originally focused on Django. Despite the course's emphasis, I chose to use FastAPI, React, and Vite to build a crypto currency dashboard. This choice highlights the flexibility of these technologies and their relevance to modern web application development.

## About the Project
